# RallySystem

This part is supposed to be a PokemonGO-like educational game. The purpose is to learn about cities in a fun and interactive way.

Current Assets from the asset store were used (and dumped again):
  - Online Maps v3 - Dumped because the style of the maps was not appealing and editable and the fonts looked blurry, no matter what I tried.
  - GO Map - 3D Map for AR - Dumped because the loading of the maps was very slow, the results were unsatisfying. Lots of problems with URP.
  - CityGen3D - Dumped! Bulky, slow, takes for ever to generate a little part of a city, meshes are extremely unoptimized, no bridges...

// All the code for that assets was deleted again - see commit history.

Currently Mapbox API for Unity is testet and it seems to work fine.



Project is currently strongly under development! So don't expect it to run properly at this moment.

Package has to be added to the project via Unitys ProjectManager.
